> A terminal-based dashboard for managing AI agent coding sessions with Git worktree isolation, tmux integration, and real-time session monitoring.

Overseer is a TUI application that helps developers organize, launch, and monitor AI agent sessions across multiple Git repositories. It provides isolated worktree-based sessions, project management, pull request tracking, and live session preview — all from your terminal.

## Features

### Session Management
- **Worktree Sessions**: Create isolated git worktrees on new branches for each AI agent session. Automatically forks from a base branch, sets up tmux sessions, and keeps your main working directory clean.
- **Project Sessions**: Attach sessions directly to a project's working directory without creating worktrees — perfect for quick experiments or when you don't need branch isolation.
- **Session Grouping**: Sessions are automatically grouped by project in a collapsible tree view.
- **Labels**: Color-coded labels to categorize and visually distinguish sessions.
- **Ordering**: Reorder sessions within projects to prioritize your work.

### Terminal Integration
- **Tmux Integration**: Automatically creates and manages tmux sessions for both the AI agent and a shell in the session's working directory.
- **One-Key Attach**: Attach to a session's tmux window directly from the dashboard.
- **Editor Launch**: Open a session's working directory in your configured editor (VSCode, Neovim, etc.).

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Live Session Preview**: Toggle between Agent and Shell stream views to see what your AI agent is doing in real-time.

### Developer Experience
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Vim-inspired keybindings — navigate with `j`/`k`, create with `n`, delete with `d`, and more.
- **Customizable**: YAML configuration for themes, launchers, editors, labels, and dashboard dimensions.
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Built in Go with minimal resource usage.

## Screenshots

### Dashboard & Session Details

The main dashboard shows your projects and sessions in a three-pane layout. Select a session to see its details in the middle pane — repository info, branch, and linked pull request status with CI checks.

### Session Creation

Create a new session with a guided form. Choose between worktree mode (isolated branch) or project mode (direct working directory attachment).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **tmux** (for session management)
- **gh** (GitHub CLI — optional, for PR tracking)
- A configured **AI agent launcher** (e.g., [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook), or custom)

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap dnlopes/overseer
brew install overseer
```

### Install to $GOPATH/bin

```bash
go install github.com/dnlopes/overseer/cmd/overseer@latest
```

### From Source

Requires **Go 1.24+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dnlopes/overseer.git
cd overseer
make build
```

The binary will be available at `bin/overseer`.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Launch Overseer

```bash
overseer
```

On first run, Overseer creates a default configuration file at:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/overseer/overseer.yaml`
- Linux: `~/.config/overseer/overseer.yaml`

### 2. Register a Project

Press `n` to create a new session. If you haven't registered any projects yet, Overseer will prompt you to add a Git repository.

### 3. Create a Session

Fill out the session creation form:
- **Name**: A descriptive name for your session
- **Repository**: Choose from registered projects
- **Create worktree**: Enable for isolated branch-based sessions
- **Base branch**: The branch to fork from (e.g., `main`)
- **New branch**: The branch name for this session (auto-generated if empty)
- **Launcher**: The AI agent to use (e.g., OpenCode, Claude Code)
- **Editor**: Your preferred editor

### 4. Attach to Session

Select a session and press `Enter` to attach to its tmux window. Press `e` to open the session directory in your editor.

### Session Modes

#### Worktree Session (Recommended)

Creates a fully isolated development environment:
- Forks a new branch from the base branch
- Creates a git worktree for the new branch
- Spawns tmux sessions (agent + shell) in the worktree directory
- Safe to run long-running or experimental agent tasks
- Easy cleanup: deleting the session removes the worktree

#### Project Session

Attaches directly to the project's working directory:
- No branch or worktree manipulation
- Uses the project's current HEAD
- Useful for quick experiments or when you don't need isolation
